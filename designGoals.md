 - need to attach page router of some sort

 - need an update items view

 - add more fields to more accurately describe workouts

 - figure out how to update page on submiting workout

 - think about overall strategy:
   - Will each workout eventually comprise training cycle
   - Will this be to complicated for just REact/firebase. Should I connect this to a backend
   - if this was training cycles. could have different types of workouts:
     - base fitness
     - strength
     - power 
     - power/endurance
     - endurance
     - performance
   - Have a calendar feature. Includes all workouts, and then add types of workouts to the calendar, all color coded like. 

   - consider different css framework. ugh
     - see the calendar feature from mobiscroll.com. This looks promising. could be the entirety of this project. oh nvm. this costs money i think
